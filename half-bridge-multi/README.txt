For this board to work properly, jumper wires must be soldered across the board with
a wire insulated to at least 600 volts:

1.  Between the two points labeled Bridge1
2.  Between the two points labeled Bridge2
3.  Between the two points labeled Bridge3
4.  Between the two points labeled Bridge4
These provide lower inductance paths between the two sides of the bridge to prevent
spikes on the bus during switching transitions.

An optional extra snubber capacitor may be soldered at the Cap+ and Cap-
connections where the PosBus and NegBus connections are made.
